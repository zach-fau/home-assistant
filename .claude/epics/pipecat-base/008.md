# Pipecat Voice Assistant Foundation

A real-time voice assistant built with Pipecat framework, featuring ultra-low latency (500-800ms) conversation for daily life management.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (3.12 recommended)
- uv package manager
- Microphone and speakers
- API keys: Deepgram, OpenAI, Cartesia

### Installation (5 minutes)

1. **Clone and enter directory**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-quickstart.git
   cd pipecat-quickstart
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Configure API keys**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

4. **Run the assistant**
   ```bash
   uv run bot.py
   ```

5. **Access web client**
   Open browser: http://localhost:7860/client

## Features

- **Ultra-low latency**: 500-800ms response times
- **Natural voice**: Professional, warm TTS voice
- **Context memory**: Remembers conversation across turns
- **Error recovery**: Graceful handling of service failures
- **Cost tracking**: Monitor API usage and costs

## Architecture

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

```bash
# Required
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key        # Speech-to-text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key          # Language model
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_key        # Text-to-speech

# Optional
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                   # Logging level
ENABLE_METRICS=true              # Performance tracking
```

### System Prompt

```python
system_prompt = """You are Alex, a helpful daily assistant..."""
```

### Voice Selection

Change TTS voice in `bot.py`:
```python
tts = CartesiaTTSService(voice_id="your_voice_id")
```

## Performance

- **Latency**: 600ms avg, 780ms p95

speedtest-cli

# Check ping to services
ping api.openai.com
```
**Solutions**:
- Verify internet connection
- Check for background downloads
- Try different network
- Adjust VAD stop_secs in bot.py

### Problem: Microphone not working
**Symptoms**: No audio captured, errors in console
**Diagnosis**:
- Check browser permissions
- Test microphone in system settings
**Solution**:
- Chrome: Settings > Privacy > Microphone
- Grant permissions for localhost
- Try different browser

### Problem: API errors
**Symptoms**: "Invalid API key" or "Rate limit exceeded"
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check .env configuration
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify keys are valid
# Check service dashboards for status
```
**Solutions**:
- Verify API keys in .env
- Check for extra spaces or quotes
- Verify billing is enabled
- Check rate limits on dashboards

### Known Issues Documentation

**Create `docs/known_issues.md`:**

```markdown
# Known Issues and Limitations

## Current Limitations

### 1. No Calendar Integration
**Status**: Out of scope for pipecat-base
**Workaround**: Assistant can discuss scheduling but can't create actual events
**Future**: Planned for next epic

### 2. English Only
**Status**: Limited to English language
**Workaround**: None
**Future**: Multi-language support planned

[Continue with more issues...]

## Known Bugs

### 1. Occasional Audio Glitches
**Symptoms**: Brief audio stutters on first response
**Cause**: Model loading on initial request
**Workaround**: Warm-up period after startup
**Priority**: Low
**Tracked**: Issue #[number]

[Continue with more bugs...]

## Edge Cases

### Rapid Interruptions
**Behavior**: 5+ rapid interruptions may confuse VAD
**Workaround**: Wait for response to start before interrupting
**Impact**: Low (rare in normal usage)

[Continue with edge cases...]

## Limitations by Design

- No persistent storage (sessions don't persist)
- No user authentication
- No production deployment setup
- Local development only

These are intentional and will be addressed in future epics.
```

### Update Pipecat Reference

**Update `.claude/docs/pipecat-reference.md`:**

Add new section:

```markdown
## Lessons Learned from Pipecat-Base Implementation

### What Worked Well
1. Using quickstart template saved 2-3 days of development
2. Configuration over code approach enabled rapid iteration
3. Cartesia provided best latency for TTS
4. VAD at 0.2s balanced responsiveness and accuracy

### Challenges Encountered
1. Initial API key setup took longer than expected
2. Voice quality testing required multiple participants
3. Cost tracking needed custom implementation

### Recommendations for Future Development
1. Start with quickstart for any new Pipecat project
2. Test multiple TTS voices with real users
3. Implement cost tracking from day one
4. Set up monitoring before optimization

### Best Practices Discovered
1. Keep system prompts concise for voice
2. Use 1-2 sentence responses as default
3. Log all API calls for cost tracking
4. Test on multiple networks for latency validation
```

### Code Documentation

**Add docstrings to key functions in `bot.py`:**

```python
async def create_pipeline():
    """
    Create and configure the Pipecat voice assistant pipeline.

    Returns:
        Pipeline: Configured pipeline with all processors

    Pipeline stages:
        1. Transport input (WebRTC)
        2. VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
        3. STT (Speech-to-Text via Deepgram)
        4. Context aggregation (user)
        5. LLM (Language model via OpenAI)
        6. TTS (Text-to-Speech via Cartesia)
        7. Transport output (WebRTC)
        8. Context aggregation (assistant)
    """
    # ...
```

### Key Considerations

- **Target Audience**: Developers familiar with Python but new to Pipecat
