# Task: Environment Setup

## Description

Set up the complete development environment for the Pipecat-based voice assistant. This includes installing required tools (Python, uv package manager), cloning the pipecat-quickstart repository, and verifying all prerequisites are met for local development.

**Approach:** Use the official pipecat-quickstart template as the foundation to minimize custom code and accelerate delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Python 3.10+ (preferably 3.12) is installed and verified
- [ ] `uv` package manager is installed and accessible via command line
- [ ] Git is installed and configured
- [ ] pipecat-quickstart repository is cloned to local machine
- [ ] Project directory structure is set up correctly
- [ ] All base dependencies from pyproject.toml can be resolved
- [ ] Microphone and speaker hardware are tested and working

## Technical Details

### Installation Steps

1. **Verify Python Installation**
   ```bash
   python3 --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher
   ```

2. **Install uv Package Manager**
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Verify installation
   uv --version
   ```

3. **Clone Pipecat Quickstart**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-quickstart.git
   cd pipecat-quickstart
   ```

4. **Inspect Project Structure**
   ```bash
   ls -la
   # Should see: bot.py, pyproject.toml, env.example, README.md
   ```

5. **Verify Audio Hardware**
   - Test microphone input
   - Test speaker output
   - Ensure both are recognized by the system

### Key Considerations

- **Python Version:** 3.12 recommended for best performance
- **uv Benefits:** Modern, fast package manager designed for Python projects
- **Repository:** Using official pipecat-quickstart provides battle-tested foundation
- **Audio Setup:** Critical for voice interaction testing

### Files Affected

- None yet - this is setup only
- Next task will create `.env` file

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- [ ] Internet connection for downloading packages
- [ ] GitHub access for cloning repository
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (~500MB for dependencies)

### System Requirements
- [ ] macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- [ ] 8GB+ RAM recommended
- [ ] Working audio input/output devices

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** XS
- **Hours:** 0.5-1 hour
- **Parallel:** false (must complete before other tasks)

## Implementation Notes

### Python Installation

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install python3.12
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue:** uv command not found after installation
**Solution:** Restart terminal or source shell configuration
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

**Issue:** Python 3.12 not available on system
**Solution:** Python 3.10 or 3.11 will work fine
```bash
python3.10 --version  # Verify any 3.10+ version
```

**Issue:** Git not installed
**Solution:** Install git via package manager
```bash
# macOS
brew install git

# Linux
sudo apt install git  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo dnf install git  # Fedora
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tools installed and version-verified
- [ ] pipecat-quickstart repository cloned successfully
- [ ] Can navigate project structure
- [ ] Audio hardware tested and confirmed working
- [ ] No blockers for next task (Service Configuration)
- [ ] Setup process documented for future reference
