# Task: Quality Assurance

## Description

Validate that the complete voice assistant meets all functional and non-functional requirements through systematic testing. Create integration tests, conduct multi-turn conversation validation, test error scenarios, and verify all success criteria are met.

**Goal:** Ensure production-ready quality before considering the foundation complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration test suite created and passing
- [ ] Multi-turn conversations tested (10+ turn flows)
- [ ] Context memory validated across conversations
- [ ] Error recovery tested (service failures, network issues)
- [ ] Latency targets verified (p95 <800ms)
- [ ] Voice quality validated (clarity, naturalness)
- [ ] Edge cases identified and documented
- [ ] Known issues documented with workarounds
- [ ] All PRD success criteria validated
- [ ] Quality checklist completed

## Technical Details

### Integration Test Suite

**Create `tests/test_pipeline.py`:**

```python
"""
Integration tests for Pipecat voice assistant pipeline.
"""

import pytest
import asyncio
from bot import create_pipeline, create_context

class TestPipelineIntegration:
    """Test complete pipeline functionality."""

    @pytest.fixture
    async def pipeline(self):
        """Create test pipeline instance."""
        context = create_context()
        pipeline = create_pipeline(context)
        yield pipeline
        # Cleanup
        await pipeline.cleanup()

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_pipeline_initialization(self, pipeline):
        """Test pipeline initializes correctly."""
        assert pipeline is not None
        assert pipeline.is_ready()

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_stt_service(self):
        """Test STT service connectivity."""
        # Simulate audio input
        # Verify transcription output
        pass

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_llm_service(self):
        """Test LLM service connectivity."""
        # Send test prompt
        # Verify response
        pass

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_tts_service(self):
        """Test TTS service connectivity."""
        # Send test text
        # Verify audio output
        pass

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_context_memory(self, pipeline):
        """Test conversation context is maintained."""
        # Exchange 1: "My name is Alex"
        # Exchange 2: "What's my name?"
        # Verify: Response mentions "Alex"
        pass

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_error_recovery(self, pipeline):
        """Test pipeline handles errors gracefully."""
        # Simulate service failure
        # Verify: Error logged, no crash
        pass
```

**Run Tests:**
```bash
# Install pytest
uv add pytest pytest-asyncio --dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Multi-turn Conversation Tests

**Test Script 1: Context Memory**
```
Turn 1: "Hello, my name is Sarah"
Expected: "Hi Sarah! How can I help you?"

Turn 2: "What's my name?"
Expected: Response includes "Sarah"

Turn 3: "Remember that I like Python programming"
Expected: Acknowledgment

Turn 4: "What do I like?"
Expected: Mentions Python
```

**Test Script 2: Task Planning**
```
Turn 1: "I need to plan my day"
Expected: Offers to help

Turn 2: "I have a meeting at 2 PM"
Expected: Acknowledges meeting

Turn 3: "What time is my meeting?"
Expected: "2 PM" or "two PM"

Turn 4: "Move it to 3 PM"
Expected: Acknowledges change

Turn 5: "When is my meeting now?"
Expected: "3 PM" or "three PM"
```

**Test Script 3: Multi-topic Conversation**
```
Turn 1-3: Discuss weather
Turn 4-6: Switch to task planning
Turn 7-9: Ask about earlier weather discussion
Expected: Can recall weather topic from earlier
```

### Error Scenario Testing

**Test 1: Service Outage Simulation**
```
1. Start normal conversation
2. Disconnect internet mid-conversation
3. Attempt to speak
Expected: Error logged, user-friendly message, no crash
```

**Test 2: Invalid API Key**
```
1. Temporarily corrupt one API key
2. Start bot
Expected: Clear error message identifying the service
```

**Test 3: Microphone Failure**
```
1. Start conversation
2. Disable microphone mid-session
Expected: Graceful handling, user notification
```

**Test 4: Rapid Interruptions**
```
1. Start speaking
2. Interrupt yourself 10 times rapidly
Expected: VAD handles properly, no crashes
```

### Performance Validation

**Latency Testing (20 samples minimum):**
```python
# scripts/latency_test.py
import asyncio
import time
from typing import List

async def measure_latency(pipeline, utterances: List[str]):
    """Measure end-to-end latency for utterances."""
    latencies = []

    for utterance in utterances:
        start = time.time()
        # Process utterance through pipeline
        await pipeline.process(utterance)
        # Wait for audio playback start
        latency = (time.time() - start) * 1000  # ms
        latencies.append(latency)

    return {
        "avg": sum(latencies) / len(latencies),
        "p50": sorted(latencies)[len(latencies) // 2],
        "p95": sorted(latencies)[int(len(latencies) * 0.95)],
        "p99": sorted(latencies)[int(len(latencies) * 0.99)],
        "max": max(latencies),
    }

# Test with 20 varied utterances
utterances = [
    "Hello",
    "What time is it?",
    "Tell me about Python programming",
    # ... 17 more
]

results = await measure_latency(pipeline, utterances)
print(f"P95 latency: {results['p95']:.0f}ms")
assert results['p95'] < 800, "P95 latency exceeds 800ms target"
```

### Voice Quality Assessment

**Subjective Rating Scale (1-5):**

**Clarity:**
- 5: Crystal clear, every word understood
- 4: Clear, occasional unclear word
- 3: Mostly clear, some effort needed
- 2: Difficult to understand
- 1: Incomprehensible

**Naturalness:**
- 5: Sounds human, completely natural
- 4: Slightly robotic but pleasant
- 3: Noticeably synthetic
- 2: Very robotic
- 1: Unnatural, jarring

**Warmth:**
- 5: Warm, friendly, inviting
- 4: Pleasant, approachable
- 3: Neutral
- 2: Cold, distant
- 1: Off-putting

**Test with 5 different people, average scores.**

### Key Considerations

- **Test Coverage:** Focus on critical paths, not 100% coverage
- **Real-world Scenarios:** Test actual use cases
- **Edge Cases:** Document, don't necessarily fix all
- **User Feedback:** Gather from real interactions

### Files Affected

- `tests/test_pipeline.py` (new)

- [ ] End-to-end latency <800ms (p95)

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- [ ] No crashes during 30-minute session
- [ ] Memory usage <2GB
- [ ] Error handling graceful
- [ ] Logs informative and structured
- [ ] Code readable with type hints
- [ ] Documentation complete

**User Experience:**

- [ ] Voice quality pleasant
- [ ] Personality consistent
- [ ] Error messages clear

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue:** Tests hanging or timing out
**Solution:** Add timeouts to async tests
```python
@pytest.mark.timeout(30)
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_pipeline():
    ...
```

**Issue:** Inconsistent test results
**Solution:** Mock external services for unit tests
```python
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

@patch('bot.DeepgramSTTService')
async def test_with_mock(mock_stt):
    ...
```

**Issue:** Multi-turn tests failing
**Solution:** Add delays between turns
```python
await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Allow processing
```

**Issue:** Voice quality ratings too subjective
**Solution:** Provide reference examples for comparison
