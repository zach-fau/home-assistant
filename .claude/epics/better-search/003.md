# Task: Document immediate acknowledgment pattern

## Description
Document the immediate acknowledgment implementation for future reference and knowledge sharing. This includes inline code comments, updating system-patterns.md with the new pattern, and updating progress tracking to reflect the completed feature.

**Goal**: Ensure the feature is maintainable, understandable, and serves as a reference for similar implementations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inline comments added to `functions/__init__.py` explaining the pattern
- [ ] New section added to `.claude/context/system-patterns.md`
- [ ] Progress updated in `.claude/context/progress.md` (if applicable)
- [ ] Comments explain WHY not just WHAT (rationale for hardcoded phrases)
- [ ] Pattern documentation includes code example
- [ ] Future enhancements noted in comments or docs
- [ ] Documentation follows existing style guide

## Technical Details

### 1. Inline Code Comments
**Location**: `pipecat-quickstart/functions/__init__.py`
**Event handler**: `on_function_calls_started`

**Add comments explaining**:
```python
# Immediate acknowledgments for slow functions (web search)
#
# Problem: Tavily API takes 3-5 seconds, causing 4-7s perceived latency
# Solution: Speak acknowledgment (<500ms) while search runs in background
#
# Why hardcoded phrases?
# - Instant execution (<1ms) vs LLM generation (1-2s)
# - Simple to maintain and extend
# - Sufficient variety to avoid robotic repetition
#
# Pattern: Function-name-based triggering
# - Only applies to slow functions (web_search)
# - Fast functions (HA) don't need acknowledgments
# - Easy to extend: add more function names to check
```

### 2. System Patterns Documentation
**Location**: `.claude/context/system-patterns.md`
**Section to add**: "Immediate Acknowledgment Pattern"

**Content structure**:
```markdown
### 8. Immediate Acknowledgment Pattern

**Problem**: Long API calls (3-5s) create silent gaps that make the bot feel unresponsive.

**Solution**: Speak hardcoded acknowledgments (<500ms) before slow function executes.

**Implementation**:
[Code example with explanation]

**Benefits**:
- Masks latency with instant feedback
- Non-blocking (acknowledgment + function run in parallel)
- Simple to extend to other slow functions

**When to use**:
- API calls taking >2 seconds
- Functions where user expects immediate response
- Not needed for fast local operations (<500ms)
```

### 3. Progress Update (Optional)
**Location**: `.claude/context/progress.md`
**Section**: Recent Activity or Completed Features

**Add entry** (if progress.md tracks features):
```markdown
### October 30, 2025
- âœ… Implemented immediate voice acknowledgments for web search
- ðŸŽ¯ Reduced perceived latency from 4-7s to <1s
- ðŸ“¦ Added hardcoded phrase pool with random selection
- ðŸ§ª Validated TTFS <500ms across 10 test runs
```

### 4. Code Comment Best Practices
**Follow project style guide** (`.claude/context/project-style-guide.md`):
- Explain WHY not WHAT (rationale, not description)
- Keep comments concise (1-3 lines)
- Use active voice ("Speak acknowledgment" not "Acknowledgment is spoken")
- Include context (problem/solution/benefits)

### Files to Update
1. `pipecat-quickstart/functions/__init__.py` - Inline comments
2. `.claude/context/system-patterns.md` - Pattern documentation
3. `.claude/context/progress.md` - Optional progress update

### Documentation Standards
**From project-style-guide.md**:
- Use Google-style docstrings for functions
- Add module-level docstrings if creating new modules
- Keep examples short and focused
- Link to related patterns when applicable

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 complete - âœ… Implementation done
- [ ] Task 002 complete - âœ… Testing validates approach
- [ ] Test results available for documentation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS (documentation only)
- Hours: 0.25 hours (15 minutes)
- Parallel: false (depends on Task 001 and 002)

**Breakdown**:
- Add inline comments: 5 min
- Write system-patterns section: 5 min
- Update progress.md: 2 min
- Review and polish: 3 min

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Inline comments added to `functions/__init__.py`
- [ ] System-patterns.md updated with new pattern section
- [ ] Progress.md updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Comments explain rationale (WHY hardcoded phrases, WHY function-specific)
- [ ] Documentation includes code example
- [ ] Future enhancements noted
- [ ] Documentation follows style guide
- [ ] Code review confirms clarity
- [ ] Committed to appropriate repositories (submodule + main)

## Documentation Template

### Inline Comments Template
```python
# [Pattern Name] for [Use Case]
#
# Problem: [What problem does this solve?]
# Solution: [What does this code do?]
#
# Why [Design Decision]?
# - Reason 1
# - Reason 2
#
# Pattern: [Brief pattern name]
# - How it works
# - When to use
# - How to extend
```

### System Patterns Template
```markdown
### N. [Pattern Name]

**Problem**: [User-facing problem description]

**Solution**: [High-level solution approach]

**Implementation**:
[Code example with explanation]

**Benefits**:
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2
- Benefit 3

**When to use**:
- Use case 1
- Use case 2

**When NOT to use**:
- Anti-pattern 1
- Anti-pattern 2
```

## Future Enhancements to Note
**Include in comments/docs**:
- Per-function phrase pools (Google Tasks, etc.)
- User-configurable phrases via config file
- Progress updates for >5s operations
- Analytics on phrase usage

**Mark as "not needed for v1"** to prevent scope creep.
