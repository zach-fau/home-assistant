# Task: Testing and Documentation

## Description
Implement comprehensive test suite covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure system reliability. Create thorough documentation including user setup guide, developer documentation for extending the system, and operational documentation for troubleshooting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test suite with > 80% code coverage for core components
- [ ] Integration tests for all major workflows
- [ ] End-to-end tests with sample audio conversations
- [ ] Performance/load tests to validate latency targets
- [ ] User documentation: setup guide, configuration, usage
- [ ] Developer documentation: architecture, adding tools, contributing
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
- [ ] API documentation for tool interfaces
- [ ] All tests passing in CI pipeline (if configured)

## Technical Details
**Test Structure:**
```

│   └── fixtures/
│       └── sample_audio/
└── performance/
    └── test_latency.py
```

**Unit Testing:**
- Test each tool's execute method with various inputs
- Mock external APIs (Deepgram, OpenAI, Cartesia, HA)
- Test configuration loading and validation
- Test error handling for each component
- Test tool registration and function schema generation

**Integration Testing:**
- Test complete pipeline with mocked audio I/O
- Test LLM function calling with tool execution
- Test conversation context management
- Test error propagation through pipeline
- Test retry logic and recovery

**End-to-End Testing:**
- Use pre-recorded audio samples for repeatable tests
- Test complete user journeys from PRD:
  - Smart home control: "Turn on kitchen lights"
  - Information retrieval: "What's the weather?"
  - Productivity: "Set a timer for 5 minutes"
  - Multi-turn conversation with context
- Validate responses are appropriate and commands execute

**Performance Testing:**
- Measure latency at each pipeline stage
- Validate P95 latency < 2.5s for end-to-end
- Test sustained load (continuous conversation for 1 hour)
- Memory leak detection
- Concurrent operation handling

**Testing Tools:**
- pytest for test framework
- pytest-asyncio for async tests
- pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- unittest.mock for mocking external services
- Audio fixtures for repeatable E2E tests

**Documentation Structure:**
