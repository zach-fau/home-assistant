- ✅ Created `StructuredLogger` wrapper with extra fields support
- ✅ Configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- ✅ Support for both text and JSON log formats
- ✅ Exception logging with traceback support

### 4. CLI Module (`src/cli.py`)
- ✅ Implemented command-line interface using argparse
- ✅ Added `--help` flag with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Added `--check-config` command for configuration validation
- ✅ Added logging control options:
  - `--log-level` for setting log level
  - `--json-logs` for JSON format output
  - `--debug` for debug mode
- ✅ Added `--version` flag
- ✅ Configuration status checking and error reporting
- ✅ Help text with usage examples

### 5. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

### 6. Environment Template (`.env.example`)
- ✅ Created comprehensive configuration template
- ✅ Documented all API keys with links to provider consoles
- ✅ Home Assistant settings with security instructions
- ✅ Logging configuration options
- ✅ Application settings (debug mode)

### 7. Git Ignore (`.gitignore`)
- ✅ Updated to exclude Python artifacts (`__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, etc.)
- ✅ Added virtual environment directories
- ✅ Added `.env` and `.env.local` to protect secrets
- ✅ Added IDE files, test artifacts, and logs

### 8. Documentation (`README.md`)

## Key Implementation Details

### Configuration Management
- Uses Pydantic v2 with `pydantic-settings` for environment variable loading
- Nested configuration structure for better organization
- Validation happens at startup with clear error messages
- Supports field aliases for environment variables

### Logging System
- Standard Python logging with custom formatters
- JSONFormatter outputs structured logs with timestamp, level, logger, message, etc.
- StructuredLogger allows passing extra fields as kwargs
- Configurable via environment variables or command-line flags

### CLI Design
- Built with argparse for robust argument parsing
- Comprehensive help text with examples
- Configuration validation before running
- Graceful error handling and user-friendly messages

## Testing Results

```bash
$ ./venv/bin/python -m src.cli --help
usage: home-voice-assistant [-h] [--check-config] [--config-file CONFIG_FILE]
                            [--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}]
                            [--json-logs] [--debug] [--version]

Home Voice Assistant - Control your smart home with voice commands
...
```

CLI tested successfully with all flags working as expected.

## Next Steps

The foundation is complete and ready for the next phase of development:

1. **Issue #5**: Implement Home Assistant API Client
2. **Issue #6**: Implement Voice Pipeline with Pipecat
3. **Issue #7**: Implement Natural Language Processing
4. **Issue #8**: Add Device Control Capabilities

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This foundational work enables all other tasks in the epic:
- Configuration system ready for API keys and settings
- Logging system ready for debugging and monitoring
- CLI ready for testing and running the application
- Project structure ready for additional modules

## Blockers

None. All deliverables completed successfully.

## Notes

- Virtual environment created at `/home/gyatso/Development/epic-initial-feature/venv/`
- All dependencies installed and verified
- Python 3.13 compatible (tested)
- Configuration system is extensible for future settings
- Logging system supports both development (text) and production (JSON) formats
