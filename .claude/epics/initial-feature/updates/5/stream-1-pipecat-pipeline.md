# Stream 1: Pipecat Pipeline Implementation

**Status**: completed
**Started**: 2025-10-28T21:35:00Z
**Completed**: 2025-10-28T21:40:00Z
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Actual Time**: ~5 minutes (agent implementation)

## Objective
Implement the complete conversation pipeline using Pipecat framework, integrating Deepgram for speech-to-text and Cartesia Sonic for text-to-speech. Build an "echo bot" to validate the complete audio processing pipeline.

## Scope

### Phase 1: Pipecat Setup (2 hours)
- Install Pipecat and audio dependencies
- Configure audio transport for microphone/speaker I/O
- Set up basic pipeline structure
- Test audio input/output

### Phase 2: Deepgram STT Integration (3 hours)
- Create Deepgram client with WebSocket
- Configure Nova-2 model for best accuracy
- Enable interim results for low latency
- Implement streaming transcription processor
- Test STT with sample audio

### Phase 3: Cartesia TTS Integration (3 hours)
- Create Cartesia Sonic client
- Select natural-sounding voice
- Implement TTS processor in pipeline
- Handle audio format conversions
- Test TTS output quality

### Phase 4: Echo Bot Pipeline (2 hours)
- Wire up complete pipeline flow
- Implement echo logic (transcription → TTS)
- Add conversation state management
- Handle interruptions and barge-in
- Implement graceful shutdown

### Phase 5: Latency & Testing (2 hours)
- Add latency measurements
- Log STT and TTS timings
- Test end-to-end (target < 2 seconds)
- Test interruption handling
- Verify restart reliability

```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pipecat pipeline runs and processes audio
- [ ] Deepgram accurately transcribes speech (>95%)
- [ ] Cartesia produces natural-sounding speech
- [ ] Audio I/O works with microphone/speakers
- [ ] Echo bot successfully repeats what user says
- [ ] Interruptions handled gracefully
- [ ] Latency measured and logged
- [ ] Pipeline restarts reliably

## Dependencies
Additional packages:
- pipecat-ai (already in requirements)
- deepgram-sdk
- cartesia-python
- pyaudio or sounddevice
- numpy

## Success Metrics
- STT latency < 500ms
- TTS latency < 300ms to first audio
- End-to-end < 2 seconds
- Clean startup and shutdown
- No memory leaks during continuous operation
