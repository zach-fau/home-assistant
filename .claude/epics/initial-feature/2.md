# Task: Error Handling and Polish

## Description
Implement comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation, and user experience refinements across the entire system. Ensure the assistant provides clear feedback for failures, recovers gracefully from errors, and delivers a polished conversational experience with optimized latency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for all API failures
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- [ ] Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- [ ] Clear, conversational error messages to users
- [ ] Audio feedback improvements (confirmation sounds, error tones)
- [ ] Latency optimization to meet performance targets
- [ ] Pipeline recovery from crashes or hangs
- [ ] User interruption handling polished
- [ ] Logging includes all errors with context for debugging

## Technical Details
**Error Categories to Handle:**

1. **API Failures:**
   - Deepgram STT: Network issues, API errors, invalid audio
   - OpenAI: Rate limits, token limits, API downtime
   - Cartesia TTS: API errors, network issues
   - Tool APIs: Home Assistant unreachable, search API limits

2. **Audio Issues:**
   - Microphone not available
   - Speaker output failure
   - Audio format incompatibility
   - Buffer overruns or underruns

3. **Tool Execution Errors:**
   - Device not found in Home Assistant
   - Invalid parameters from LLM
   - Timeout waiting for tool response
   - Permission/authentication failures

**Error Handling Strategy:**
```python
class ErrorHandler:
    """Centralized error handling with user feedback"""

    async def handle_api_error(self, error: Exception, service: str):
        """Handle API failures with retry logic"""
        if isinstance(error, NetworkError):
            # Retry with exponential backoff
            pass
        elif isinstance(error, RateLimitError):
            # Wait and retry
            pass
        else:
            # Inform user and continue
            await self.speak_error(f"I'm having trouble connecting to {service}")

    async def handle_tool_error(self, error: Exception, tool: str):
        """Handle tool execution failures"""
        # Log error with full context
        logger.error(f"Tool {tool} failed: {error}", exc_info=True)
        # Provide conversational feedback
        await self.speak_error(f"I wasn't able to complete that action. {self.get_friendly_message(error)}")
```

**Retry Logic:**
- Transient network errors: 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Rate limits: Wait for rate limit reset, inform user
- Persistent failures: Fail gracefully, inform user, continue conversation

**Graceful Degradation:**
- If TTS fails: Display text response on console (if available)
- If STT fails: Attempt to restart, fallback to text input
- If Home Assistant unavailable: Continue conversation, disable HA tools temporarily
- If OpenAI unavailable: Major failure, inform user, retry connection

**User Feedback:**
- Confirmations: "Okay", "Done", "Lights are now on"
- Errors: "I'm sorry, I couldn't do that because...", "Let me try that again"
- Network issues: "I'm having trouble connecting right now"
- Ambiguity: "Did you mean [option A] or [option B]?"

**Audio Feedback:**
- Brief confirmation tone for successful commands
- Error tone for failures
- Thinking tone (optional) during long operations

**Latency Optimization:**
- Profile pipeline to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize hot paths (caching, parallel execution)
- Use streaming for all API responses
- Preload frequently accessed data (HA device states)
- Measure and log latencies at each stage

**Pipeline Recovery:**
- Watchdog to detect hung operations (timeout after 30s)
- Automatic restart of pipeline on critical failures
- Preserve conversation context across restarts if possible
- Log all crashes with full stack traces

**Interruption Handling:**
- Detect user speech during assistant response
- Immediately stop current TTS playback
- Process new user input
- Smooth transition without jarring artifacts

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004, 005, 006 (all tools) completed
- [ ] Core pipeline operational

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all tools to be implemented first)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All API errors caught and handled gracefully
- [ ] Retry logic works for transient failures
- [ ] Error messages are clear and conversational
- [ ] System continues operating when non-critical components fail
- [ ] Latency targets met: P95 < 2.5s end-to-end
- [ ] Audio feedback enhances user experience
- [ ] Pipeline recovers automatically from crashes
- [ ] Interruptions work smoothly without glitches
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of all errors with context
- [ ] Error handling tested with simulated failures
- [ ] User acceptance testing validates error message quality
