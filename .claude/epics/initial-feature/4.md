# Task: Project Foundation and Configuration Setup

## Description
Establish the project foundation with proper Python project structure, dependency management, configuration system, and development infrastructure. This includes setting up the development environment, configuring API credentials, implementing logging, and creating a basic CLI for component testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Python 3.11+ project structure created with proper package layout
- [ ] Dependency management configured (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)
- [ ] Environment configuration system with `.env` support for API keys
- [ ] Configuration validation on startup with clear error messages
- [ ] Structured logging with configurable levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- [ ] Basic CLI entry point for testing individual components
- [ ] README with setup instructions and prerequisites
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly configured to exclude sensitive files

## Technical Details
**Project Structure:**
```
home-assistant/
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py          # Configuration loading and validation
│   ├── logger.py          # Logging setup
│   └── cli.py             # Command-line interface
├── tests/
│   └── __init__.py
├── .env.example           # Template for environment variables
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

**Key Dependencies to Include:**
- pipecat-ai (core framework)
- python-dotenv (environment configuration)
- aiohttp (async HTTP client)
- pydantic (configuration validation)
- PyYAML (optional config files)

**Configuration System:**
- Load API keys from environment variables (DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, CARTESIA_API_KEY)
- Validate required configuration on startup
- Support optional config.yaml for user preferences
- Clear error messages for missing/invalid configuration

**Logging Strategy:**
- Use Python's logging module with structured output
- Log to console with configurable format
- Include timestamps, log levels, and module names
- Option to log to file for debugging

## Dependencies
- [ ] Python 3.11+ installed on development machine
- [ ] API keys obtained for Deepgram, OpenAI, and Cartesia Sonic
- [ ] Git repository initialized

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (blocks all other work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Project structure created and documented
- [ ] Dependencies installed and working
- [ ] Configuration loads successfully from .env file
- [ ] Validation catches missing API keys with helpful errors
- [ ] Logging outputs properly formatted messages
- [ ] CLI runs with `--help` showing available commands
- [ ] README includes complete setup instructions
- [ ] Code committed to Git with .gitignore working correctly
