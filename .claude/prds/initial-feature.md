# PRD: Home Voice Assistant with Pipecat

## Executive Summary

Build a production-ready voice assistant system that enables hands-free productivity and smart home control through natural conversation. The system leverages Deepgram for speech recognition, GPT-4o-mini for intelligent responses, and Cartesia Sonic for natural text-to-speech, all orchestrated through the Pipecat real-time conversation framework.

This assistant will serve as a capable productivity tool, allowing users to accomplish meaningful work, control their smart home, search the web, and interact with various services entirely hands-free.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Existing voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri) have significant limitations:
- Limited integration with smart home platforms beyond their ecosystems
- Restricted in capabilities and extensibility
- Poor at handling complex, multi-step tasks
- Privacy concerns with cloud-based processing
- Inability to meaningfully assist with productivity work

### The Problem
Users need a voice assistant that:
- Provides genuinely useful productivity assistance
- Integrates deeply with Home Assistant and smart home devices
- Offers extensible capabilities through custom tooling
- Maintains privacy and local control where possible
- Enables hands-free completion of meaningful work

### Why Now
- Pipecat provides a robust framework for real-time conversational AI
- Modern LLMs (GPT-4o-mini) are capable enough for complex reasoning
- Low-latency STT (Deepgram) and TTS (Cartesia Sonic) enable natural conversation
- Home Assistant provides a mature platform for smart home integration
