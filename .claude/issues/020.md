# Issue #20: agent cant access google tasks tool

## Description

*(No description provided in GitHub issue)*

**Problem**: The assistant cannot access the Google Tasks tool/function. Need to debug why the tool isn't available in the function registry.

## GitHub Details
- **Created**: 2025-10-30T21:25:30Z
- **State**: OPEN (will be closed on GitHub)
- **Labels**: None
- **URL**: https://github.com/zach-fau/home-assistant/issues/20

## Resolution

**Root Cause**: The Google Tasks integration was commented out in `functions/__init__.py` (lines 137-140), and the `functions/google_tasks.py` module didn't exist yet.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created `functions/google_tasks.py` with 4 function handlers:
   - `list_tasks`: List tasks from task lists
   - `create_task`: Create new tasks with title/notes/due date
   - `update_task`: Update existing task properties
   - `complete_task`: Mark tasks as completed

2. Uncommented and enabled the integration in `functions/__init__.py`

3. All handlers follow existing patterns from `home_assistant.py` and `web_search.py`

4. Uses existing `google_auth.py` for OAuth 2.0 authentication

**Commit**: `6cbe0aa` - Issue #20: Add Google Tasks integration with function calling

**Files Changed**:
- `pipecat-quickstart/functions/google_tasks.py` (new, 478 lines)
- `pipecat-quickstart/functions/__init__.py` (enabled integration)

## Testing

The integration is now registered and will be available when the bot starts. To test:
1. Start bot: `uv run bot.py`
2. Ask: "What tasks do I have?" or "Add a task to buy groceries"
3. Verify the assistant can access Google Tasks functions

## Next Steps
- [x] Investigate why Google Tasks functions aren't registered ✅ Completed
- [x] Check function registration in `functions/__init__.py` ✅ Fixed
- [x] Verify Google Tasks module exists and exports correctly ✅ Created
- [x] Test function calling after fix - Ready for user testing
